Alma Mater, a song from the builders,
You embody the goal to attain,
Hear a song from the hearts of the wielders,
Of compass and transit and chain.
Alma Mater, your name and your story,
We raise our glad voices to thee,
We will strive for the fame and glory,
Of Map√∫a University
We will follow the light and the new prints,
We will trace on the footpaths of arts,
For our land, we the makers of blueprints,
Will struggle to fulfill our part.
When away from your doors have been parted,
Thy sons in the flight of the years,
Still conscious and firm and whole hearted,
We will hail thee with songs and with cheers.
